# Ghost

ghost (Grand Hub Of Spectral Tools) is the friendly phantom that helps you do signal processing on neuroscience data, especially spectral analysis ;)

It can be used as a standalone package for numpy arrays, or as a companion plugin module to nelpy. Currently it supports rudimentary wavelet analysis. Planned features include multitaper Fourier methods, phase-amplitude & phase-phase coupling, current source density analysis, and more.

ghost tries to be as lightweight yet fast as possible. Suggestions for increasing efficiency and performance are always welcome!

## Installation
